The Greenbone Security Assistant is the web interface developed for the
[Greenbone Security Manager
appliances](https://www.greenbone.net/en/product-comparison/).

It connects to the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager **GVM** to provide a
full-featured user interface for vulnerability management.

Greenbone Security Assistant consists of

* [GSA](https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/tree/master/gsa) - The webpage written in [React](https://reactjs.org/)

and

* [GSAD](https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/tree/master/gsad) - The HTTP server talking to the [GVM daemon](https://github.com/greenbone/gvmd)

This gpg key can be downloaded at https://www.greenbone.net/GBCommunitySigningKey.asc
and the fingerprint is `8AE4 BE42 9B60 A59B 311C  2E73 9823 FAA6 0ED1 E580`.

## Installation

This module can be configured, built and installed with following commands:

    cmake .
    make install

For detailed installation requirements and instructions, please see the file
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

If you are not familiar or comfortable building from source code, we recommend
that you use the Greenbone Community Edition, a prepared virtual machine with a
readily available setup. Information regarding the virtual machine is available
at <https://www.greenbone.net/en/community-edition/>.

## Usage

In case everything was installed using the defaults, then starting the HTTP
daemon of the Greenbone Security Assistant can be done with this simple command:

    gsad

The daemon will listen on port 443, making the web interface
available in your network at `https://<your host>`.

If port 443 was not available or the user has no root privileges,
gsad tries to serve at port 9392 as a fallback (`https://<your host>:9392`).

To see all available command line options of gsad, enter this command:

    gsad --help

## Support

For any question on the usage of `gsa` please use the [Greenbone Community
Portal](https://community.greenbone.net/c/gse). If you found a problem with the
software, please [create an issue](https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/issues) on
