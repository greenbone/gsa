GSA INTERNATIONALIZATION HOWTO
##############################

Requirements
============
In addition to the usual GSA requirements, the following are needed as well:
- msgmerge and xgettext (part of the GNU gettext tools)
- Python (scripts were tested with version 2.7.3)
- polib (Python gettext manipulation library)

If you are using a .po file editor, make sure it supports "msgctxt" and
 plural forms correctly. (Some older editors may not.)


General notes
=============
- GSA uses UTF-8 text encoding, so you should use this for your translations
 as well.
- Most GSA pages now use gettext for translations while the custom XML-based
 format is no longer used. (See section "Migrating old XML translations" on
 how to migrate translations using this format.)
- Help pages are translated separately. See "Translating help pages" for more.
- The locale codes used by GSA should be either
 * an ISO 639 two-letter language code, like "de" for German
 * an ISO 639 two-letter code followed "_" and an ISO 3166 country code, like
   "pt_BR" for Brazilian Portuguese


Updating existing translations
==============================
To update existing translations using the gettext format follow these steps.
 For old XML-based translations, see "Migrating old XML translations".

Summary
-------
1) Create new template files with
  make gettext-pot

2) Merge the template with the .po files in the source directory

3) Edit the merged .po file

4) Copy the .po file back to the source directory, renaming as necessary


1 - Creating new template (.pot) files
--------------------------------------
To create a new template file simply run

  make gettext-pot

which will generate the file and "gsad_js.pot" in the "src/po"
 subdirectory of your build directory.
You can then use this as a template for your new translation or merge it with
 existing translation files.

To only create a template file for the JavaScript you can also use the
  make target "gettext-js-pot".


2 - Merge the template and existing translations
------------------------------------------------
a) Using a custom tool

To merge the template and existing translations with a tool other than the
 basic pomerge you need to import / specify the following files:
- The .pot files generated in step 1
- The .po files from the "src/po" subdirectory of your GSA source directory.

b) Using make and pomerge

If your tool does not have its own functions for merging translation files,
 you can use the following make target to merge the new .pot file with the
 current .po files from the source directory:

  make gettext-merge

This will generate "gsad_js-XX-merged.po"
 files in the "src/po" subdirectory of your build directory,
 with "XX" being a locale code as defined above in the section "General notes".

There is also a separate make target for JS .po files, gettext-js-merge.


3 - Update the translations
---------------------------
Next you can update the actual translations in the .po file.

If you want to edit the translations locally you can also copy them as
 described in step 4 before editing them.


4 - Copying the new .po files
-----------------------------
The next step is to copy the files for your language back to "src/po" in the
 source directory, naming the files "gsad_js-XX.po",
 with "XX" again being the locale code.

As this means overwriting the old source .po file, you should verify the new
 file is correct and/or backup the old file first.


Creating new translations for another locale
============================================
1 - Creating the template (.pot) file
-------------------------------------
The first step to a new translation is generating new template (.pot) files.
To do so, follow the first step under "Updating existing translations".

The destination file of the make target "gettext-pot" is "gsad_js.pot" in
the "src/po" subdirectory of your GSA build directory.


2 - Preparing the .po files
---------------------------
Next you have to use the generated files as templates for your new translation.

Once you are finished or want to install the in-progress translation for
 testing, copy it to "src/po/gsad_js-XX.po" in your source directory with "XX"
 being the locale code as defined above in the section "General notes".


3 - Setting up the installation
-------------------------------
In the file "CMakeLists.txt" in the "src/po" of your GSA source directory add an
additional line

  MAKE_TRANSLATION (XX)

near the other MAKE_TRANSLATION (...) lines, with "XX" again being the 
 locale code.

Also add your language to the dependencies of the targets
 "gettext-mo", "gettext-json" and "gettext-js-merge"
 again replacing XX with the locale code:

    add_custom_target (gettext-json
                       [...]
                       DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/gsad-XX.json
                       [...])

    add_custom_target (gettext-js-merge
                       [...]
                       DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/gsad_js-XX-merged.po
                       [...])


Migrating old XML translations
==============================
Translations using the old XML-based format can be partially migrated by
 converting the old XML file to PO.

1 - Convert the XML to PO
-------------------------
First run the XML to PO conversion script:

  python "${SRC_DIR}/tools/xml2po" "${XML_FILE}" "${PO_FILE}"

with ${SRC_DIR} being the GSA source directory, ${XML_FILE} the XML translation
 file and ${PO_FILE} the destination po file.
The destination file should be "gsad_xsl-XX.po" in the "src/po" subdirectory of
 your GSA source directory, replacing "XX" with the locale code as defined
 above in the section "General notes".


2 - Set up the build file
-------------------------
Next you should set up the build file for your newly migrated language as
 described in point 3 of the section "Creating new translations".


3 - Create and merge the .pot file
----------------------------------
Next create a new .pot file and merge it with the .po file you just generated
 as described in the section "Updating existing translations".

Many of the translations will be marked as unfinished / fuzzy as many context
 names were changed as part of switching to the gettext format. You should be
 able to quickly change them with a suitable .po file editor.
Beware that there are also some cases where the actual message text has changed
 as well, mostly to make messages less fragmented.

After updating the messages, proceed as you would with a regular update of the
 translation.
Since the migration leaves many unused contexts and text fragments it may be
 a good idea to remove the unused messages to reduce the file size once the
 update is complete.


Message Contexts
================
Some messages in GSA use the msgctxt to avoid ambiguity, for example if a
 word like "login" could be used both as a noun or as a verb.
Unlike previous versions of GSA contexts are only used for this kind of
 disambiguation.

Typical contexts and rules
--------------------------
* If a word or phrase can be used both as a verb and a noun, like "Login",
  the verb should be given the context "Action Verb".

* If a string contains an adjective but not the corresponding noun, the implied
 noun should be used as a context, e.g. "Active" should have the resource type
 like "Note" as the context.

* Property names which may be ambiguous should have the resource type
 or some kind of category as the context.

* Other ambiguous value should have the property name as context. If the
 property name would also be ambiguous, a context as described in the previous
 rule should be prepended followed by a "|", e.g. "Alert|Email"

* Some special contexts that may override some of the above:
  - "Pagination" is used for strings on pagination controls like a "Next" page
   button


Translating help pages
======================
Translations for the help pages are contained in a file called "help_<lc>.xsl",
where <lc> is the two-letter language code the translation is for.

For the stylesheet to work properly, it must include the default "help.xsl"
at the beginning.

Next should be the named templates, which must use different names than the
included default stylesheets. This is to avoid conflicts which would not only
affect the template, but cause all of the XSL transformation to fail.

For consistency you should use the name of their default stylesheet equivalent
suffixed with an underscore and the language code.
For example "availability" becomes "availability_de" if the language code is
"de".

After this the "Page not found" template should be placed, followed by the
individual page templates.

The new help file should also be UTF-8 encoded and has to be installed in the
directory ${GSA_DATA_DIR}/classic.
