          <h3>Version 7.1+beta1</h3>
          <p>The Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) is the web-based graphical
            user interface of the Open Vulnerability Assessment System
            (OpenVAS). GSA connects to OpenVAS Manager via the OpenVAS
            Management Protocol (OMP). By implementing the full feature set
            of OMP, GSA offers a straight-forward, yet powerful method to
            manage network vulnerability scans.
