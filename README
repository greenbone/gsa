Howto use
---------

Starting Greenbone Security Assistant:

In case everything was installed using the defaults, then starting the daemon
of the Greenbone Security Assistant can be done with this simple command:

    gsad

The daemon will then listen on port 443, in other words the web interface
is available in your network under "https://<your host>".

If port 443 was not available, gsad tries to serve at port 9392 as a fallback
("https://<your host>:9392").

To see all available command line options of gsad enter this command:

    gsad --help
