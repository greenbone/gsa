  Use the full filter string for identifying if a single report is loaded
  currently.

  When storing a loaded report use the simplified report because
  with the current implementation the rows, first and sort(-reverse) filter
  terms are not relevant. Therefore we can consider these reports to be equal
  and store them under the same identifier. This will safe us some memory.
