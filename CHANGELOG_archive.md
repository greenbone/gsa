[8.0.1]: https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/compare/v8.0.0...gsa-8.0

## [8.0.0] - 2018-04-05

This is the first release of the gsa module 8.0 for the Greenbone
Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework.

This release introduces an entirely re-written version of GSA with an overhauled
new user interface technology, switching from XSLT-generated web pages per
request to a single page JavaScript application. The XSLT got removed
completely and was replaced by a modern JS application allowing to add features
and usability improvements faster and easier in future.

The web server daemon (gsad) got a big code cleanup and improvements. Due to
changing to a JS application it doesn't generate any HTML code anymore. Now gsad
only ships static files and acts as some kind of http proxy between the JS
based GSA and gvmd.

Apart from this, the module covers a number of significant advances
and clean-ups compared to the previous gsa module.

[8.0+beta2]: https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/compare/v8.0+beta1...v8.0+beta2

## [8.0+beta1] - 2018-05-25

This is the first beta release of the gsa module 8.0 for the Greenbone
Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework.

This release introduces an entirely re-written version of GSA with an overhauled
new user interface technology, switching from XSLT-generated web pages per
request to a single page JavaScript application. The XSLT got removed
completely and was replaced by a modern JS application allowing to add features
and usability improvements faster and easier in future.

The web server daemon (gsad) got a big code cleanup and improvements. Due to
changing to a JS application it doesn't generate any HTML code anymore. Now gsad
only ships static files and acts as some kind of http proxy between the JS
based GSA and gvmd.

Apart from this, the module covers a number of significant advances
and clean-ups compared to the previous gsa module.

### Added
- The 'excluded' list option when a New Target is created has been added.
- New view on scan results by vulnerability has been added.
- A link to Scanconfigs from scanner details has been added.
- Multiple dashboards can be defined by the user at the main entry page.

### Changed
- The web user interface has been transformed into a single page application
  which is loaded once and then only updates the in-browser data from the
  server.
- All data loading processes are asynchronous and don't block the GUI from
  reacting to user input.
- Refreshing of data is done in the background now. Therefore the user doesn't
  need to specify a refresh rate anymore.
- The extra help pages has been replaced by links to the documentation.
- The edit dialog for overrides and notes has been improved and is now more
  flexible.
- The report details view has been overhauled.
- nodejs >= 6 is required to generate the new JS based version of GSA.
- npm or yarn is required for installing the JavaScript dependencies.
- Minimum required version of glib has been raised to 2.42.
- Minimum required version of cmake has been raised to 3.0.

### Removed
- The its "face" has been removed.
- The 'classic hosts' asset has been removed.
- The edit mode of the dashboards has been removed. Dashboards are always
  editable now.
- libxslt is no longer required because all XSLT has been removed.
- The required minimum version of new dependency GVM Libraries is 1.0 and
  the dependency to the openvas-libraries module has been removed. Therefore
  many include directives have been adapted to the new source code.
